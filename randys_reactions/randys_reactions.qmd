## Jan 28th homework

NICE!  I loved reading your notes on R-Ladies!  Thanks! Nice chart too!  Some notes:

* Are you going to join r-ladies?!?
* Nice use of the quartz theme!  And you used some formatting (e.g., italics).  
* With your chart, make sure to insert the URL so you or others can find it later
* The comments are excellent.  If you wrote them-nice, if they came with the code, look them over as an example.
* Good work with parameterizing the code chunks.
